/// Cameron Garchow's Pause Menu
/// Currently this pause menu pauses the game when escape is hit. It is bound inside of its own canvas and object to prevent issues
/// There is currently a bug that has to deal with the GROW functionality in unity editor. Which prevents us from building the scene.
/// The only way to fix this is to delete the editor functionality from all objects that retain this functionality
/// Once it is deleted we can then load the scenes and build them.
/// This menu system is currently in working order, right now if exit to main menu is clicked it won't do anything but send a debug command.
/// Once we have deleted the old functionality it will work.
